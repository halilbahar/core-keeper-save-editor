  <h1>How to Use</h1>

  <p>
    <b>Core Keeper Save Editor</b> is a tool that allows you to easily modify your character save
    files. Currently, it is possible to modify the <b>Inventory</b>, <b>Skills and Talents</b>,
    <b>Unlocked Souls</b> and <b>Character Information</b>.
  </p>

  <br />

  <h3>Importing Save Data</h3>
  <p>
    In order to modify an existing character, you first need to <b>import</b> the save file of the
    character into the application. Click the <b>Import</b> button in the top menu and choose the
    save file you want to edit.

    <br /><br />

      this guide</a
    >, if you are not sure where to find Core Keeper's save files. Character save files are found in
    the <b>/saves</b> directory and are labeled <b>&lt;index&gt;.json</b>. For example, if you want
    import the character from the second character slot, you need to select <b>1.json</b> (index
    starts at 0).
  </p>

  <br />

  <h3>Exporting Save Data</h3>
  <p>
    To export your modified save file and load it into the game, click the <b>Export</b> button in
    top menu and overwrite the original <b>.json</b> file. We highly recommend creating a backup of
    your original save file before this step in order to avoid any potential losses.

    <br /><br />

    Because of the way the game loads character save-data, the game needs to be restarted to load
    modified save files. To make sure save files will be loaded correctly, close the game before
    exporting and importing save files and restart it afterward.
