  <h1>How to use</h1>

  <p>
    <b>Core Keeper Save Editor</b> is a tool that allows you to easily modify your character save
    files. Currently, it is possible to modify the <b>Inventory</b>, <b>Skills and Talents</b>,
    <b>Unlocked Souls</b> and <b>Character Information</b>
  </p>

  <br />

  <h3>Importing save data</h3>
  <p>
    In order to modify an existing character, you first need to <b>import</b> it into the
    application. Click the <b>Import</b> button in the top menu and choose the save file you want to
    edit.

    <br /><br />

    Check
    <b

        >this guide</a
      ></b
    >
    if you are not sure where to find Core Keeper's save-files. Character save-file are found in the
    <b>/saves</b> directory and are labeled <b>&lt;index&gt;.json</b>. For example, if you want to
    import the character in the second character-slot, you need to selected <b>1.json</b> (index
    starts at 0).
  </p>

  <br />

  <h3>Exporting save data</h3>
  <p>
    To export your modified save-file and load it in the game, click the <b>Export</b> button in the
    top menu and overwrite the original <b>.json</b> file. We highly recommend creating a backup of
    your original save-file before this step in order to avoid any potential losses.

    <br /><br />

    Because of the way, the game loads character save-date, the game needs to be restarted to load
    the modified save-file. To make sure the save-file will be loaded correctly, close the game
    before exporting the save-file and restart it afterward.
