# Contributing to Core Keeper Save Editor

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to **Core Keeper Save Editor**!

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via **Issues** and **Pull Requests (PRs)**. Before creating an Issue or PR make sure to search for existing Issues and PRs before.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the application or request a new feature. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our application are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question.
- Include documentation of your changes in form of comments for the purpose of comprehensibility.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

### Branch naming convention

Prefix your branch name with either `fix` or `feature` for bugfixes or features respectively, followed by the issue number and a concise descriptive name in snake case.

Examples:

* feature/#123_removing_items_from_inventory
* fix/#1234_items_overflowing
* fix/#123_skill_calculation
